# K-Nearest Neighbors

The purpose of this repository is my self practice of the K-Nearest Neighbors model. Exercise from the Book "Data Science from Scratch"

I am a student that is learning, let me know if you find any errors,the code is inspired from examples and exercises found in books.

## The idea behind nearest neighbors classification

The model requires only a notion of distance and an assumption that points that are close to one another are similar

- It neglects a lot of information, since the prediction depends only on a few points close to the new point

- Doesn't help to understand the drives of whatever phenomenon


## Working with the Iris data set

* 3 different species
* measurements: petal and sepal length, petal and sepal width

The purpose of this project is to build a model that can predicts the species of the flower from the measurements of the petal and the sepal



## Resources that I used to learn about this fun topic:
Book: Data Science from Scratch, Joel Grus
